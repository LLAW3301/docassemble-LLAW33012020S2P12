  # Legal Aid

  # CourtSA
  CourtSA is a one-stop-shop for your court enquiries. 
  
  **Call them:** +61 8 8204 2444 or Freecall 1800 571 191
  
  **Email them:** enquiries@courts.sa.gov.au 
  
  **Live chat with them:** https://courtsa.courts.sa.gov.au/?q=node/160 
  
  We recommend that in addition to seeking support and advice from legal aid, you contact CourtSA for any urgent matters.
  
  ## Actioning a Current Matter
  If you have a matter in court that you are aware of, and you intend to represent yourself, you can also create an account to access all of the relevant information for your matter and create actions on your matter. You can create an account here: https://courtsa.courts.sa.gov.au . Be sure to use their helpful guide. 
  
  **We recommend first seeking legal aid services to better understand your situation. This system will NOT provide support in resolving your legal issues. It will only allow you to take action on matters. Seeking legal aid services first is highly recommended. If you later decide to represent yourself, this option remains.**
