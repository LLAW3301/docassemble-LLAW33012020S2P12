This is our application for the St Vincent de Paul's Men's Crisis Centre.
The application has been written to help users in their journey to obtain identification documents relevant to them, find legal aid resources and also find basic court contacts.
The main aim of the application is to create an easy and simple platform through which the users can obtain basic information as well as further contacts and steps to follow to get where they want to go.
